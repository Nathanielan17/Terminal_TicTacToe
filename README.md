# Terminal_TicTacToe

Purpose of this repo/project is to familiarize myself with C++. This is a tictactoe script that allows the user to play tictactoe against the computer within the terminal. Currently the computer/AI uses the minimax algorithim to select its move.

The user can continue to play as many rounds as they desire by entering 'y' after every round. There is a scoreboard that shows the amount of wins/points the user and computer have each round.
