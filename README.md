# Terminal_TicTacToe

Purpose of this repo/project is to familiarize myself with C++. This is a tictactoe script that allows the user to play tictactoe against the computer within the terminal. Currently the computer move selection algorithim just selects an available move randomly. Future improvements will be to make the computer 'smarter' when selecting moves.
