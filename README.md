# Terminal_TicTacToe

Purpose of this repo/project is to familiarize myself with C++. This is a tictactoe script that allows the user to play tictactoe against the computer within the terminal. Currently the computer move selection algorithim just selects an available move randomly. Future improvements will be to make the computer 'smarter' when selecting moves.

The user can continue to play as many rounds as they desire. There is a scoreboard that shows the amount of wins/points the user and computer have each round.
